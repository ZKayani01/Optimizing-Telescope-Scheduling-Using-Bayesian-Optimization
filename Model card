# Model Card



## Model Description

**Input:** The inputs to the model are the observational logs, weather conditions, and celestial object characteristics. Specifically, the features include:

Date and time of observation
Weather conditions (cloud cover, humidity, temperature, wind speed)
Telescope availability (binary indicator)
Celestial object data (object type, brightness, right ascension, declination)

**Output:** The model outputs a scheduling priority score for each potential observation, which indicates the suitability and importance of scheduling the observation at a given time. This score is used to optimize the telescope's schedule.

**Model Architecture:** The model architecture used is a Random Forest Regressor due to its robustness in handling diverse types of input data and its ability to model complex interactions between features. The architecture consists of:

100 decision trees (estimators)
Each tree with a maximum depth of 10
Bootstrap sampling to ensure variability among the trees
Mean squared error (MSE) as the criterion for measuring the quality of splits

## Performance

Summary Graph or Metrics:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The model's RMSE on the validation set is 5.3, indicating the average error in the scheduling priority score.
R-squared (R²): The model's R² score is 0.82, suggesting that 82% of the variance in the scheduling priority can be explained by the model.
Feature Importance: Analysis shows that weather conditions, particularly cloud cover and humidity, are the most significant features affecting the scheduling priority.
Performance Measurement:

The performance was measured using a train-validation split (80-20) on the dataset.
Cross-validation was performed with 5 folds to ensure the model's generalizability.

## Limitations

Weather Data Accuracy: The model's performance heavily relies on the accuracy of weather forecasts. Inaccurate weather data can lead to suboptimal scheduling decisions.
Temporal Changes: The model may not adapt well to rapid changes in weather conditions or telescope availability without frequent retraining.
Bias: Observational biases in the dataset, such as overrepresentation of certain celestial objects, might affect the model's generalization to different observational priorities.

## Trade-offs

While the Random Forest model provides a balance between performance and interpretability, it is still less interpretable than simpler models like linear regression. This trade-off is necessary to capture the complex relationships in the data.
Training a Random Forest model with 100 trees can be computationally intensive, particularly with large datasets. This trade-off is made to achieve higher prediction accuracy.
The model performs well on historical data, but its performance may degrade if the real-time conditions deviate significantly from the training data. Continuous monitoring and retraining are required to mitigate this issue.
